### ðŸ‘‹ PATRICK AMBROSE
**`Cloud | DevOps | Data`**

As a person with an affinity to be resourceful, data-driven and concise, I gravitate towards learning and implementing things that increase productivity and solve problems that yield actionable business solutions. In my current role, I collaborate with cross-functional teams and other stakeholders to make sure the SAP master data is accurate, build systems to plan, manage inventory and predict material shortage impact. In my leisure hours, I learn UX design, Interior design, woodworking and 3D modelling.
